# soccer-predictions
This is a notebook that runs simulations of 2018 World Cup qualification phases (using data from [http://kickoff.ai], but anything else providing team strengths can be used). The goal is to explore the probability distributions associated with some particular bets (betting on what team will end up in what final phase).

## Launch
- Use python 3 in a virtualenv.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `jupyter notebook wc2018-phases-predictions.ipynb`
